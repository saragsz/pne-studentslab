The program throws an error (ZeroDivisionError) at the precise moment when the function t1 is set to 0,
when the operation on the variable t3 (line 11) is executed and when trying to divide by 0,
the error occurs because it is impossible.
This will happen any time that a and c takes the same value because the substraction gives the 0 value.

This could be fixed by changing the value of c or d to one that does not generate the value 0.(not the same)
That is why results 1,3 and 4 are properly computed.
